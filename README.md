# _The Went-To-Bali E-commerce Refactor Extravaganza_

#### _A refactoring project intended to salvage the remains of an ecommerce site that was left high-and-dry by a developer who decided to move away without leaving behind a high-quality product. {May 4, 2018}_

#### By _Masen Matthews_

## Description
  _This project is designed to simulate a situation where the main developer for an e-commerce site randomly decides to move away to Bali. The developer didn't leave behind a good README, any sort of well-kept commit history, and many swaths of code that could use some refactoring. Naturally, the goal of this project is to remedy all of these issues. Additionally, AJAX is added to enhance the online shopping experience._
